flexcraft
=========

Control software for the FlexCraft Simulator (FCS), a robotic platform located in the Flight Robotics Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.

After cloning into your local filesystem, here are steps to help you get going:
```
#initialize the workspace
cd path/to/flexcraft/src
catkin_init_workspace

#build the project for the first time
cd ../
catkin_make

#if things seem to not be working
source flexcraft/devel/setup.bash
```
